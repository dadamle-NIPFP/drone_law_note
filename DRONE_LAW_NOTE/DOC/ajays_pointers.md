# These are Ajay's notes from last year on a paper on drone policy

1. Introduction:
   1000 word summary

2. The new world of drones:
   Talk about the capabilities out there - very small drones on the palm of your hand, classes of outdoor drones with lithium batteries & wifi, petrol powered drones, the increasing migration of autonomy and logic onto the drone so that it becomes more driverless car than RC toy.

3. Applications:
   Civilian
   Government

4. Concerns about law and order
   Drones can be a tool for pulling off old crimes in new ways.
   * Describe existing and hypothetical crimes:
     ** using drones to fly mobile phones & drugs & weapons into jails
     ** invasion of privacy 
     ** acid attack on a drone
     ** mount guns on a drone
     ** use of drones by ISIS on the battlefield in Iraq
     ** US/UK/AU experience with criminal schemes that use drones
     ** etc

5. What is unique about India:
   Mechanically copying international experience is always wrong. We have to grow deep roots (Metis) about our backyard and come up with meticulous solutions that fit our backyard. This always requires asking the question: What's  unique about our setting? How are we different from elsewhere in the world?
  Eg. We know that drones are great after a disaster for doing a PDNA, for finding individuals who are stranded, and mounting a rescue. Yes, that's an easy place where there's nothing unique about India, so we can pretty much just mimic what others do.
   But in numerous other areas, India is different, and our edge must be our ability to think from first principles and not merely copy what others have done. A review of the international experience is a terrible way to do policy thinking.

  What's uniquely Indian about the drone story? What I can think of:

   - We have poor infrastructure in many remote places, and both the government and private persons can jumpstart many activities if drones let us overcome the infrastructure problem. There is a list of places and goods where drone transportation is cheaper and for all these places, it is transformative to suddenly jump up to drone transportation instead of waiting for conventional transportation to get better.

   - We don't have a horizontal privacy law so the use of drones for invading privacy may at present not be adequately proscribed by the law

   - The Indian State is an early stage of establishing law and order, i.e. establishing the monopoly of violence in the hands of the State. The justice system works badly. Drone-based crime poses new challenges for the executive and judiciary.

   - India is a technological superpower while (say) Canada is not. We can play a leadership role with this new world also. If we ban drones, we will never be able to build them. E.g. Indian prowess in building mobile phone software would not have existed if we had not done the telecom reforms of 1999 through which mobile phones became ubiquitous in India.

6. The menu of choices for policy actions
   * Legislative
     ** What kinds of restrictions can be contemplated
   * Executive
     What kinds of actions can be undertaken
     Examples:
     ** You can ask for an IMEI on every drone. But most drone makers in the world don't have this as of today. The US FAA is currently at the notice/comment stage on this. And, you have to remember that the Jihadis already know how to make their own drones so they will bypass this.
     ** No-fly zones coupled with infrastructure to take down violators.
     ** Innovation policy interventions such as competitions that spur R&D. I thought of one interesting angle: I wonder if there are one or more competitions where the exact same competition is  done in the US/UK/AU/CA. This would be interesting because it would give us evidence about the gap between the top ranking Indian performance vs. the top ranking global performance. Another interesting angle is to pay a bounty to a person in India who wins in a stated global competition. Another interesting angle  is to setup 10 research programs in the top research universities with the explicit goal of winning #1 in a chosen list of global competitions.
     ** This is where you have to think tangibly about the set of steps that begins when a drone-based crime takes place and a citizen complains to a first responder on phone. What are all the things that have to be in place to get to good outcomes? Think tangibly about going  all the way to writing process manuals for all concerned persons.

   * No Drone SEZ please. Our job is to fix the mainland. SEZ only makes sense when you are up against intractable bottlenecks like Ministry of Labour or RBI.

7. The present policy framework:
   What we do today, how it does not make sense, how it is giving us the wrong outcomes.

8. Finding the balance:
   * Arguments that lead up to drafting instructions for the law.
   * I think you are going way too far with restrictions on manufacturing, import, selling, buying!
   * I have serious problems with a lot of your policy stuff. E.g. you say drones should not be used to carry drugs. Why? Is this not covered amply by existing law? Your new law should not need to say that murder is a crime. Murder is already a crime.
   * Autonomy is wonderful, autonomy is coming, and autonomy means that the UAV does not go on a fixed and predictable flightpath. Please do not code a world of fixed flightpaths into the policy plans.

8. Conclusion
